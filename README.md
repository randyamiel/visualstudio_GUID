This is an example project to demonstrate the creation of sequential GUID values for use as primary keys in database tables under various database types.
It is intended to accompany my article [GUIDs as fast primary keys under multiple databases](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/388157/GUIDs-as-fast-primary-keys-under-multiple-database).

A Visual Studio solution containing two projects:

* SequentialGuid - A small library containing the types and methods to generate sequential GUIDs using the method outlined in the article.
* SequentialGuid.Demo - A WinForms application demonstrating the generation and use of sequential GUIDs.
